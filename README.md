Plants my suprize you and maybe they are more than most think they are.

Visualization for Plant Consciousness:
This project aims to create a real-time visualization of GSR data from a live plant, seamlessly handling computer sleep and wake states to ensure continuous communication. It serves as a simple starting point for exploring the intriguing, and often controversial, discussions around plant consciousness.

The fascination with plant responsiveness dates back to the 1970s when researchers like Cleve Backster suggested plants could sense human emotions through experiments with polygraph tests, which stirred much debate. Today, the conversation has evolved with scientists like Monica Gagliano, PhD, whose peer-reviewed studies explore plant learning, memory, and communication in ways that challenge traditional boundaries of consciousness.

This visualization project not only showcases the plant's dynamic response to its environment but also invites viewers to reflect on the evolving scientific narrativeâ€”from the initial curiosity of the 1970s to the groundbreaking insights of modern-day research.

 If you wanted to see an aspect of your plant try this code, you will need a Arduino UNO or similar and a GSR sensor Plus your plant.
 The Arduino C .ino file code for your Arduino or SBC Bellow

 Connect The 2 GSR sensors to plant, 
  - One connected to metal rod in the earth/pot -conducts via moisture to roots
  - One connected to the plants stem, crockidile clip

 void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at 115200 baud rate
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Set pin A0 as an input for the GSR sensor
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Variable to store the sum of readings
  int total = 0;
  int loops = 100;
  float last = 0.0;
  float loopf = float(loops); // Correct conversion to float for division
  float offset = 200.0;       // Offset to avoid negative values

  float extract_decimal = 0.0; // Added missing semicolon

  // Read the value from A0 a certain number of times and accumulate the sum
  for (int i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
    total += offset + analogRead(A0); // Use analogRead to get a range of values (0-1023)
    delayMicroseconds(10); // Small delay to space out the readings, adjust as needed
  }

  // Calculate the average by dividing the total by loopf
  float average = total / loopf;

  // Print the averaged value to the Serial Plotter if it's different from the last value
  if (average != last) {
    Serial.println(average);
    last = average; // Update the last value after printing
    delayMicroseconds(798); // Small delay to space out the readings, adjust as needed
  }

  // Optional delay to control the output frequency (adjust as needed)
  delay(39); // Adjust to control the rate of output (in milliseconds)
}
